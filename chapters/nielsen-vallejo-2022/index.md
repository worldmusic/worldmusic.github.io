**Nationalism:** *The concept that people, lands, and cultures are divided into nations that provide a central component of citizens’ identities.*

Modern nationalism developed in Western Europe in the revolutionary
atmosphere of the late eighteenth century. During this time, the
nation-state became increasingly central to defining territories and the
peoples who inhabited them.[^1] Nationalism seeks to homogenize and
unite those within a territory, often antagonizing individuals within
its borders who do not conform and are therefore considered a threat to
a perceived national unity.

Nationalist movements in the 1800s sought to create musics to reflect
the desired ideals of nations. This imperative emerged as European
nations increasingly defined themselves in opposition to each
other and the growing number of colonies. European nationalist composers
often drew on melodic or rhythmic traits considered particularly
indicative of national styles. Because music is a symbolic medium, the
meaning of these rhythms and melodies was culturally established:
Listeners and composers were themselves cultivated to hear certain
traits as nationalist, developing these musical symbols of nationalism
(Beckerman 1986:73). Many nationalist composers have drawn on collected
folk culture and music from across territories and peoples subsumed into
nations. These folk collections are presented as a shared national
heritage or folk culture. In many cases, these projects claimed to
"save" or "preserve" culture, often by notating versions of oral
traditions in written forms, effectively freezing them into one single
"official" version. Music books and media, such as radio, recordings and
film, aided the dissemination of a shared national culture that sought
to cultivate national identity as a dominant force in citizens’ lives
(See Anderson 1983; Boyes 2010).

In formerly-colonized lands, nationalism reflects a complicated
mixture of both liberation and the continuation of colonial power
structures. With the advent of independence movements, lands that were
previously colonized by European nations have sought to create their own
national identities, including musical identities. In doing so, they
have frequently drawn on the same model as European nations that push a
homogenized cultural form as a shared national heritage. Following the
European model of turning to "the folk," or communities seen as
preserving older strata of culture, many countries have appropriated
these musics as sources of national music heritage. In countries like
Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador, the music of Indigenous communities---many
of whom remain wary of state governments because of histories of
genocide---has been co-opted into indigenismo nation-building projects
in the twentieth century.[^2] One famous example is "El Cóndor
Pasa," a piece from the eponymous zarzuela (operetta) composed in 1913
by Peruvian composer and ethnomusicologist Daniel Alomía Robles. Similar
efforts have taken place in African countries where governmental
organizations have played significant roles in shaping a shared national
culture in the second half of the twentieth century when many African
nations gained independence. In countries like Ghana, government
organizations have supported performances with different ethnic groups
representing cultures across its territories (Agawu 2003:19). These
efforts face the challenges of representation: What music represents
diverse nations of people, often speaking many different languages? Who
gets to decide?

Settler colonial states---meaning the dominant population is
descended from colonizers who have oppressed Indigenous communities
through acts of genocide, systematic dispossession of lands, and
cultural repression---have also used music to define themselves. These
nation-states, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and South
Africa, may recognize some differences among groups of people when those
differences do not challenge the nationalist rhetoric. Yet overall, they
demand assimilation and depend on native societies losing their land,
language, and cultural practices (Simpson 2014; Wolfe 2006).

Political and social figures have showcased---and in many cases,
misrepresented---musical styles and dances that they feel should be
celebrated as "roots" music representing their idea of a nation. For
example, Appalachian old-time and country music in the United States has
been overwhelmingly portrayed as Anglo- and Euro-American music; the
African and Black roots of these musical styles were intentionally
down-played and erased in part through the efforts of wealthy,
Anglo-Americans such as Henry Ford (See Brucher 2016).

So how do communities and musicians respond to nations and ideas of
national musics when these same musicians often find themselves
systematically excluded? In some cases, people push for inclusion and
recognition, finding spaces for marginalized identities to be viewed and
heard as part of a national heritage. This approach might be observed
when the lyrics of a national anthem includes several languages; for
instance, South Africa changed their national anthem following apartheid
to better reflect the inclusive ideals of a new era (see example below). Research and
scholarship have also played an important role in amending histories
that have marginalized communities (See Hay 2003; Flemons 2018; Our
Native Daughters 2019). Another example is mariachi music, which has
been embraced as a representative of Mexican and Latin American cultures
in the United States and public-school music curricula. At the same
time, it can also be understood as a vital U.S. American music given its
significance within the United States today (See Salazar 2011; Sheehy
2006).

In other cases, various racial, ethnic, and economic social groups
within a nation may disagree, redefine, or create their own definitions
of what their national music is (Wong 2012). And whereas it may be
assumed that membership within a nation is or should be an end goal for
those who are marginalized and seeking the benefits of citizenship,
there are contexts in which rejecting membership of one nation may be
preferred in order to advocate for the sovereignty of another identity
group. Music, along with other culturally-identifying practices such as
language and dance, have often been central for people resisting or
rejecting a nationalist identity during the twentieth and twenty-first
centuries, such as the second Hawai\'ian Renaissance Movement\'s protest
songs and renewed interests in Hawai\'ian language, chant and dance
(Lewis 1987; Stillman 1995:4-5).

In summary, although nationalism in its current form is a relatively
recent phenomenon that began among colonial European nations, today it
structures assumptions of how humans organize themselves, cultures, and
musics. While music may create affinity within nations, musical
nationalism does so by excluding others---often by erasing communities
and practices all together.

[^1]: A nation-state is defined as an entity in which a majority of citizens identify with each other culturally. It retains autonomy over the corresponding land inhabited by those who identify as its citizens.

[^2]: A political strategy to co-opt Indigenous culture into nation-states while excluding Indigenous people.

### Discussion Questions

1. In the passage above, it is mentioned that folklore projects "claimed to 'save' or 'preserve' culture, often by documenting or freezing versions of oral traditions in written forms." In many cases, however, there are multiple versions of songs, meaning that decisions must be made about which versions to preserve or make "official" by publishing. What problems might arise in this process? Who should get to make these decisions about which songs join folk music canons and which ones are left out? What might be some consequences of these choices?

2. Are people able to claim an identity or membership within a nation or political grouping even if they are not recognized as a member from the nation or political grouping? Why or why not? What are some of the identity issues that arise when one\'s claims to membership may or may not be recognized by a larger group? How might these discrepancies impact musical performance?

3. Make a list of rights or benefits that are awarded to someone who is able to claim citizenship to a nation state. Then consider what is at stake for someone who is denied citizenship to a nation state.

4. Conduct an internet search using Google or a database like JSTOR to read about plurinationalism. Find an example of how this is practiced in a given nation state or country. What are some of the social challenge of this political structure? How does music relate to the ways this plurinational state is represented?
