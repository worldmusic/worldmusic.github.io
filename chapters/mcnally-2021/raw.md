**Discussion questions:**

How has music been used as a vehicle for antiracist activism in Brazil?
What parallels do you see between antiracist popular songs in Brazil and
similar movements in the international sphere?

What kind of image of the nation of Brazil did nationalist popular songs
seek to create? How has this changed over time? Is this image similar to
how you think about your country?

Brazilian songwriters have often faced suppression and censorship from
authoritarian government figures. How have Brazilian popular songwriters
enacted social critiques in their songs despite these restrictions?

What are some of the ways that Brazilian popular song was influenced by
international genres of popular music? What are some of the ways in
which Brazilian popular song sounded back out into the international
sphere in turn?

Watch a video of *maracatu* in the Recife Carnival, then watch the music
video of Chico Science and Nação Zumbi's song "Maracatu Atômico." Can
you see or hear any similarities? How are the videos different?

Compare the music of the Bahian Carnival to its adaptations in the
popular sphere. First, listen to Ilê Aiyê's 1975 song "Que Bloco É
Esse?" (an example of *samba-afro*) and Gilberto Gil's 1977 cover of
that same song, "Ilê Aiyê." Then, listen to Olodum's 1986 song "Faraó,
Divinidade do Égito" (an example of *samba-reggae*) and Margareth
Menezes's 2004 cover of that same song, "Faraó." How did the songs
change as they were adapted into the popular sphere via the recording
industry?

Listen to "Chega de Saudade" and "Garôta de Ipanema," then listen to
Eydie Gormé's "Blame it on the Bossa Nova" and Elvis Presley's "Bossa
Nova Baby," both of which were written during the period in which bossa
nova became globally popular. If you were a bossa nova musician, what
would you think of these adaptations?

Watch a video of Elis Regina's "Arrastão," Chico Buarque's "Roda Viva,"
Gilberto Gil's "Domingo no Parque," or Caetano Veloso's "Alegria,
Alegria," all of which took place during the era of the 1960s Festivals
of Popular Song. Describe the scene: the energy of the space, the
theatricality of the performances, the sonic qualities of the
performance, the interactions between musicians and audience. What do
these qualities say about the place of popular song in Brazilian culture
during this time period?
