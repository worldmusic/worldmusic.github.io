Liz Przybylski. Hybrid Ethnography: Online, Offline, and In Between will be published by SAGE shortly: The methodology addresses research in a fieldsite that integrates both online and offline components. This does respond to several of the questions you raise—such as ethics and techniques in online ethnography. Of particular relevance for researchers who are transitioning to a digital fieldsite after partially completing research primarily offline, the book offers ways to integrate research conducted face-to-face, online, and in mediated spaces that span the two. I am happy to answer questions about the methodology, particularly between now and when the book is released; you can reach me at liz.przybylski@ucr.edu or 815-793-4535.

Singing the Congregation: How Contemporary Worship Music Forms Evangelical Community. Monique Ingalls incorporates both in-person and virtual fieldwork for much of her book, but what you're looking for is probably most concentrated in Chapter 5 (Worship on Screen).

autoethnography and designing research "at home" (wherever that may be!). The chapter by Christopher Hale in The Oxford Handbook of Music and World Christianities (edited by Suzel Ana Reily and Jonathan M. Dueck)

Jungwon Kim's dissertation (UC Riverside) on K-pop fandom incorporates aspects of her own experience as a K-pop fan before and into her choice to go into ethnomusicology; her references may be helpful in finding additional sources for autoethnography

Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology (edited by Jonathan McCollum and David G. Herbert). The discussions in Chapter 2 about music as data and the emerging digital humanities may be helpful. This collection also has some very overt discussions about ethics in research, which are applicable to traditional fieldwork methods or virtual.

Ethnography and Virtual Worlds: A Handbook of Method by Tom Boellstorff, Bonnie Nardi, Celia Pearce, and T.L. Taylor. Even though it was published in 2012, it holds up as a great primer for anyone interested in ethnographic methods for analyzing online cultures

Blending online and in-person ethnographic methods. Kiri Miller’s Playable Bodies (2017) and Playing Along (2012) come to mind, as does Trevor Harvey’s article “Virtual Worlds: An Ethnomusicological Perspective” in the Oxford Handbook of Virtuality. Books like Suk-Young Kim’s K-Pop Live and Katherine Meizel’s Idolizedalso offer unique approaches to constructing the field, taking into account media industries, people, and various popular culture discourses

Networked creativity : ethnographic perspectives on chipmusic  (2015, by Marilou Polymeropoulou)  

https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2020/05/on-remote-fieldwork-and-shifting-gears/ - The American Folklife Center recently initiated a series of Folklife Today blogs on remote fieldwork. These will explore both technical resources and the more philosophical aspects of working with interviewees and communities in this disorientating time. My colleague Michelle Stefano did a really nice job on the opening blog and I'm sending along a link to it both FYI and also because it might be a thought-provoking piece to share with students. Best wishes, Nancy Groce
