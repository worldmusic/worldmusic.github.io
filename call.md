You are invited to consider contributing to a new open world music textbook. *World Music Textbook* aims to assemble a collection of original writing and multimedia resources for use in the world music classroom while provide a public resource for other educational and research uses.

## Scope and style

This project takes a broad view of "world music" that includes historical and theoretical writing as well as other formats. We welcome contributions of short documentary films, interview transcriptions, oral histories, interactive projects that take advantage of our online delivery.

These materials will be:

* Free and open to all
* Short, accessible, and written for an undergraduate student or general readership
* Flexible in a way that allows instructors to draw thematic connections between a variety of geographic and historical contexts

We welcome writing of roughly 1,000 to 2,000 words or films and multimedia projects of a similar scope. We are interested in all types of content that is accessible to general audiences.

Our hope is that these materials will derive from personal fieldwork experiences or work with primary sources (broadly defined) that illuminate significant ethnomusicological themes through compelling narratives.

## Organization

The *World Music Textbook* will live exclusively online and be in an open format. By highlighting focused contributions, it will serve as an adaptable educational resource. The site will use a tag system to link and filter contributions by both geographically and thematically.

Examples of themes include (but are not limited to):

* Analysis
* Dance
* Diaspora
* Environment
* Fieldwork and analysis methods
* Identity
* Ideology
* Indigeneity
* Industries
* Gender
* Globalization
* Government
* Medicine and health
* Memory/nostalgia
* Modernity
* Power
* Religion
* Representation
* Technology
* Tradition
