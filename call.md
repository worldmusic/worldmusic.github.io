You are invited to contribute to a new open world music textbook. *World Music Textbook* aims to assemble a collection of original writing and multimedia resources for use in musicology and ethnomusicology classrooms. We envision a resource that can also serve the public in other educational and research uses.

## Scope and style

This project takes a broad view of “world music” that includes historical and theoretical scholarship  alongside interviews, reflections, commentaries, or other forms of writing. We welcome contributions of short documentary films, oral histories, interactive projects that take advantage of our online delivery, or other forms of presentation, as well.

These materials will be:

* Free and open to all
* Short, accessible, and aimed toward an audience of undergraduate students or general readership
* Flexible to allow instructors to draw thematic connections between a variety of geographic and historical contexts

We welcome writing of roughly 1,000 to 2,000 words or films and multimedia projects of a similar scope. We are interested in all types of content that are accessible to general audiences.

Our hope is that these materials will derive from teaching experiences, personal fieldwork experiences, or work with primary sources (broadly defined) that illuminate significant ethnomusicological themes through compelling narratives.

## Organization

The *World Music Textbook* is in an open format and lives exclusively online. It will serve as an adaptable educational resource capable of meeting a variety of needs ranging from those of introductory world music courses to thematic or region-specific courses. To meet these various needs, the *World Music Textbook* will use a tag system to link and filter contributions both geographically and thematically.

Examples of themes include (but are not limited to):

* Analysis
* Archives and preservation
* Dance
* Diaspora
* Environment
* Ethics
* Fieldwork and analysis methods
* Identity
* Ideology
* Indigeneity
* Industries
* Gender
* Globalization
* Government
* Medicine and health
* Memory/nostalgia
* Modernity
* Power
* Race and ethnicity
* Religion
* Representation
* Technology
* Tradition
