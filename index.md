The *World Music Textbook* is a new collaborative effort to create a free and broadly accessible resource for educators, students, and researchers alike. Its open collections of scholarly, peer-reviewed writing and multimedia materials will focus on increasing access to diverse voices, writing styles, and audiences, all with undergraduate students and a general readership in mind.

This project’s vision is the creation of an adaptable free textbook. Its content will be created by researchers and practitioners who address musical practices and broad themes that are close to their own expertise and experience. Educators will be able to assign short-form materials to demonstrate theoretical, methodological, and geographic connections. Filtered listings, tags, curated collections, and sample educational materials will highlight a range of methods for teaching the role of music within society, musical and social histories, and approaches to scholarship.

While our project is still in development, we have a sample of the type of undergraduate- and general audience-focused writing that we intend to include. We also encourage submissions in other formats, including short documentary videos, interviews and oral histories, or interactive projects that take advantage of the opportunities of online delivery.

The *World Music Textbook* will also present annotated collections of other resources that are available across the web (see the “Other online resources” link, above, for examples). If you manage or know of a good resource, please contact the editors at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) for consideration.
